# OHR
OpenHAB Reporter

## Current Status
Beta.

## What Is It?
OHR is a TLA and stands for "OpenHAB Reporter". [OpenHAB](https://openhab.org) is "a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home". OHR is an aid to documenting an OpenHAB installation or writing a user manual for a smart home. OHR was born of my realisation that I should provide adequate documentation for my own smart home for the future when someone else takes it over.

OHR reads OpenHAB's JSON Database (currently only the file `org.eclipse.smarthome.core.thing.Thing.json`) and – currently – produces a report on the bindings therein, ordered by thing, bridge, model and binding. It also creates SVG diagrams with the same information for those who prefer pictures.

OHR stores all this information in a file tree that fits perfectly into a [Dokuwiki](https://dokuwiki.org) installation. The generated text and diagrams contain hyperlinks that also work nicely with Dokuwiki.

OHR reports are generated by [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org) using customisable templates. The SVG diagrams are generated using [nidi3/graphviz-java](https://github.com/nidi3/graphviz-java) and [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org) and can also be customised to a certain extent.

OHR creates Dokuwiki text files, some of which also contain SVG data, in a hierarchical file tree that has the following structure:

```
<link prefix>/
  bindings/
    <binding name 1>/
      auto-svg.txt
      auto.txt
      start.txt
      models/
        <model name>/
          start.txt
          auto.txt
      bridges/
        <bridge name>/
          start.txt
          auto.txt
      things/
        <bridge name>/
          start.txt
          auto.txt
    <binding name 2>/
    ...
    <binding name N>/
```
The "auto" files (those whose names start with "auto", i.e. `auto-svg.txt`, `auto.txt`) are (re)generated each time OHR is run, so previous versions are overwritten. OHR only creates "start" files (`start.txt`) if there is not already one there, so users can modify start files to their heart's content, knowing that the content will not be overwritten (unless something goes dreadfully wrong, of course, but you've made a backup anyway, haven't you?). Users are also free to add any further files to the file tree that are needed in their environment. Thus the documentation of the smart home system can be documented in the normal wiki fashion but with a snapshot of the actual OpenHAB system included and linkable.

## Usage
When OHR is started, the following window is displayed:

![OHR Main Windows](https://github.com/winnall/ohr/blob/master/Documentation/Images/Main%20Window.png)

The "Run" tab is the only one that currently shows any content. The other form elements are used as follows:

Label | Content | What | Usage
----- | ------- | ---- | ------
JSON Database | folder name | folder containing JSONDB | drag folder, click on field for a folder chooser, or type a folder name
Output | folder name | folder to create output in | drag folder, click on field for a folder chooser, or type a folder name
Link Prefix | Dokuwiki path | path in Dokuwiki format under Dokuwiki home where file tree will be installed | `openhab:localhost`, `my:smart:home:report`
Zipped Output | check box | whether to create a ZIP file instead of a file tree | _currently unimplemented_
Cancel button | | | terminate the application without running
Run button | |  | run the application and terminate

## Sample Report Pages
The following are some sample outputs generated by OHR.

### Report Home Page
This is not a page generated directly by OHR, but a hand-crafted Dokuwiki home page that points at reports generated for three different OpenHAB installations, s-oh-00, b-mq-00 and b-mq-02.

![Report Home Page](https://github.com/winnall/ohr/blob/master/Documentation/Images/Report%20Home%20Page.png)

The following is the Dokuwiki page source that results in the above home page:

``` dokuwiki
Home Page

==== s-oh-00 Bindings ====
{{page>openhab:s-oh-00:bindings:auto}}

==== b-mq-00 Bindings ====
{{page>openhab:b-mq-00:bindings:auto}}

==== b-mq-02 Bindings ====
{{page>openhab:b-mq-02:bindings:auto}}

```

`openhab:s-oh-00`, `openhab:b-mq-00` and `openhab:b-mq-02` are three _link prefixes_ (see above) or Dokuwiki paths, each of which contains an OHR for each of three OpenHAB installations.

## Supported Platforms
OHR is designed to work on MacOS, Linux, Unix, Windows and iOS. However, each of these platforms has slightly different conventions, for which a platform-specific class in OHR has to be modified. This is trivial for people with knowledge of the platforms. A little love for the platform is also necessary to ensure that all the application is well-behaved on that platform (i.e. it observes all the platform's conventions: look, feel and general good manners).

The only currently implemented platform is MacOS. Volunteers with a love for the other platforms will be supported as far as possible. More details can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/winnall/ohr/wiki/Implementing-Additional-Platform-Support).

## Installing and Running
OHR was implemented using Apache Netbeans 12.0 and Maven. Details of the varikous software versions used can be viewed in the file `pom.xml`. I'm aware that this is not very user-friendly, but it is currently the only way I know of pointing you in the right direction even after something changes...

To build your own version, clone the repository to somewhere in your file system, go there and execute the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```

This will create a MacOS application in `target/OpenHAB Reporter.app` and a JAR file in `target/ohr-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. The JAR file can be run in situ using the rudimentary shell script `oh-report.sh`, which lives in the root folder of the OHR installation.

At an early stage of OHR development, OHR could be run from the command line. The code to do that is still in there, but I must confess that I have not tried it recently.

## Further Information
Please see the [OHR wiki on Github](https://github.com/winnall/ohr/wiki) for further information, background and plans for further development.
