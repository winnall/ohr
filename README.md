# OHR
OpenHAB Reporter

## What Is It?
OHR is a TLA and stands for "OpenHAB Reporter". [OpenHAB](https://openhab.org) is "a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home". OHR is an aid to documenting an OpenHAB installation. OHR was born after I realised that I should provide adequate documentation for my own smart home for the future when someone else takes it over.

## Supported Platforms
OHR is designed to work on MacOS, Linux, Unix, Windows and iOS. However, each of these platforms has slightly different conventions, for which a platform-specific class in OHR has to be modified. This is trivial for people with knowledge of the platforms. A little love for the platform is also necessary to ensure that all the application is well-behaved on that platform (i.e. it observes all the platform's conventions).

The only currently implemented platform is MacOS. Volunteers with a love for the other platforms will be supported as far as possible. More details can be found in the wiki at ...
